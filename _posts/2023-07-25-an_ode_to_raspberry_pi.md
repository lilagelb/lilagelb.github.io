title: "An Ode to Raspberry Pi"
---

As anyone who has known me for more than about 5 seconds will know, I have a bit of a thing for Raspberry Pi. 
In fact, looking at my laptop, it currently bears 6 different stickers featuring the Raspberry Pi logo, and just from 
where I'm sitting in my room writing this post, I can see 5 Pis.
So yeah, you might say I'm fond of them.

## The Beginnings

This fondness goes back a long way.
The Raspberry Pi was what I first learned to code on, messing around with Scratch (back when it had a grey background - 
remember that?) and turtle in Python. Those basic games and cool patterns gave way to small-scale electronics projects,
initially under the watchful eye of my dad, which later gave way to some, though I say so myself, *really* cool 
projects.
Those heady days of keyboard-bashing on the original 28-pin Pi are long behind me now, but their legacy is an impressive
one.

## Raspberry Pi and Education

The work that Raspberry Pi (or more specifically, the Raspberry Pi Foundation) does, getting people into computing, is a
cause close to my heart. 
They provide countless online resources, both for those teaching themselves and for teachers in schools, as well as
facilitating the running of coding groups (split into Code Clubs and CoderDojos) all over the world, which teach kids to
code, for free.
This is particularly important in my opinion; Raspberry Pi is there for *everyone*, and the work it does in getting
underrepresented and marginalised groups into STEM is vital and impactful.

I volunteer at my local CoderDojo, and it's always so rewarding to see the people who come along go through the same
process of discovery and creativity as I did all those years ago. 
I know that many attendees won't go on, as I did, to pursue a career in computer-science- and electronics-related areas,
and that's fine - the world is a beautiful, diverse place. 
But if in all the years I've volunteered there, even just one person discovered a joy for computing that they would
never have otherwise found, then that will have made it more than worth it.

## Raspberry Pi for Everyone

What really makes a Raspberry Pi special in my eyes is the ubiquity of its appeal: it is as easy as it could possibly
be for someone just starting out in computer programming (Raspberry Pi even doubles up its APIs for regional spelling
discrepancies to make programming as natural as possible for beginners - e.g. both `colour` and `color` work when 
setting the colour of a SenseHAT display); but equally its being a Linux machine means that there's virtually no limit
to what an advanced user can do with it.
No matter your level of experience, you can do something amazing with a Raspberry Pi.

I think this constant appeal, and the accessible price tag, has also really helped cement the Raspberry Pi as *the*
single-board computer when starting out on any project (it certainly is for me). I've used them to (and this is by no
means an exhaustive list)
- Control and monitor my 3D printer with OctoPrint and OctoPi
- Build a robot capable of autonomous navigation with ROS
- Make an interactive model of the parts of a flower using the GPIO, a handful of LEDs and reed switches, and a magnet
- Set up a media server using Plex
- Build a 32kB EEPROM emulator (okay, that was with a Pico, not a standard Raspberry Pi, but it still bears the logo, so
    I'm allowing it)

And the beauty of it is that you never feel like you're fighting the system - the software support afforded to the Pi is
unrivalled, the internet is host to a truly vast number of guides for turning your Raspberry Pi into virtually anything,
and the array of out-of-the-box solutions is dizzying (just boot up the Raspberry Pi Imager and look at all the 
different custom OSes you can install).

{% assign image-caption = "My 3D printer under the watchful eye and steady hand of a Pi Zero 2 W (white case, top left)" %}
{% include post/post_image.liquid %}

So, if you haven't yet played around with a Raspberry Pi, I implore you to do so - they are cheap to get hold of, and 
you will learn an enormous amount - it really is what you make of it.
And if you have, and you've knowledge of and experience with programming and/or electronics, see if there's a CoderDojo
or Code Club near you where you could volunteer - trust me, it's worth it.

And to Raspberry Pi: thank you!
